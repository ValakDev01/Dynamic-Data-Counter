# Dynamic Data Counter Project ğŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ğŸ’¬

This React app is a dynamic counter that allows users to increment or decrement the count based on a customizable step value. The Counter component manages two state variables: count (the current count) and step (the increment/decrement step). The current date is adjusted by the value of count, displaying either how many days in the future or past the modified date is, or the message "Today is:" if the count is zero. Users can adjust both the count and step via buttons, providing an interactive experience.
